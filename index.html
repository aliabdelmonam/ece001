    <h2><u>*What is an operating system?</u>
</h2> 
  
    <h4>_An operating system (OS) is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot program, manages all of the other application programs in a computer. The application programs make use of the operating system by making requests for services through a defined application program interface   <a href="https://searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com/definition/application-program-interface-API?_gl=1*1wh5fwc*_ga*NzQwMDAxNDk2LjE2MjI4Njk2NTU.*_ga_RRBYR9CGB9*MTYyMjg2OTY1MS4xLjEuMTYyMjg3MDAzNC4w&_ga=2.128773258.72260002.1622869655-740001496.1622869655">(API)</a>
. In addition, users can interact directly with the operating system through a user interface, such as a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical UI (GUI).

    <h2><u>*Why use an operating system?</u>
</h2>
    <h4>_An operating system brings powerful benefits to computer software and software development. Without an operating system, every application would need to include its own UI, as well as the comprehensive code needed to handle all low-level functionality of the underlying computer, such as disk storage, network interfaces and so on. Considering the vast array of underlying hardware available, this would vastly bloat the size of every application and make software development impractical.

Instead, many common tasks, such as sending a network packet or displaying text on a standard output device, such as a display, can be offloaded to system software that serves as an intermediary between the applications and the hardware. The <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/system-software">system software</a> provides a consistent and repeatable way for applications to interact with the hardware without the applications needing to know any details about the hardware.

The system software provides a consistent and repeatable way for applications to interact with the hardware without the applications needing to know any details about the hardware.</h4>
    <h4>As long as each application accesses the same resources and services in the same way, that system software -- the operating system -- can service almost any number of applications. This vastly reduces the amount of time and coding required to develop and debug an application, while ensuring that users can control, configure and manage the system hardware through a common and well-understood interface.</h4>

This vastly reduces the amount of time and coding required to develop and debug an application, while ensuring that users can control, configure and manage the system hardware through a common and well-understood interface.</h4>
    <h4>Once installed, the operating system relies on a vast library of device <a href="https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/driver">drivers</a> to tailor OS services to the specific hardware environment. Thus, every application may make a common call to a storage device, but the OS receives that call and uses the corresponding driver to translate the call into actions (commands) needed for the underlying hardware on that specific computer. Today, the operating system provides a comprehensive platform that identifies, configures and manages a range of hardware, including processors; memory devices and memory management; chipsets; storage; networking; port communication, such as Video Graphics Array (VGA), High-Definition Multimedia Interface (<a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/HDMI">HDMI</a>) and Universal Serial Bus (<a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/USB-Universal-Serial-Bus-USB-30-SuperSpeed-USB">USB</a><span>)</span>; and subsystem interfaces, such as Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (<a href="https://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/definition/PCI-Express?_gl=1*widsf3*_ga*NzQwMDAxNDk2LjE2MjI4Njk2NTU.*_ga_RRBYR9CGB9*MTYyMjg2OTY1MS4xLjEuMTYyMjg3MDg5OC4w&amp;_ga=2.94405786.72260002.1622869655-740001496.1622869655">PCIe</a><span>)</span>.</h4>

       <h4>The CLI, or <em>terminal mode window</em>, provides a text-based interface where users rely on the traditional keyboard to enter specific commands, parameters and arguments related to specific tasks. The GUI, or <em>desktop</em>, provides a visual interface based on icons and symbols where users rely on gestures delivered by human interface devices, such as touchpads, touchscreens and mouse devices.</h4> 
        <h4>The GUI is most frequently used by casual or end users that are primarily interested in manipulating files and applications, such as double-clicking a file icon to open the file in its default application. The CLI remains popular among advanced users and system administrators that must handle a series of highly granular and repetitive commands on a regular basis, such as creating and running scripts to set up new personal computers (PCs) for employees.</h4>

<h3><h2><u>Application management.</u></h2> <h4>An operating system handles the launch and management of every application. This typically supports an array of behaviors, including timesharing multiple processes, or threads, so that various tasks can share the available processors' time; handling interruptions that applications produce to gain a processor's immediate attention, ensuring there is enough memory to execute the application and its corresponding data without interfering with other processes; carrying out error handling that can gracefully remove an application's processes; and performing memory management without disrupting other applications or the OS.</h4>
</h3>
<h4>An operating system can also support APIs that enable applications to utilize OS and hardware functions without the need to know anything about the low-level OS or hardware state. As an example, a Windows API can enable a program to obtain input from a keyboard or mouse; create GUI elements, such as dialog windows and buttons; read and write files to a storage device; and more. Applications are almost always tailored to use the operating system on which the application intends to run.
</h4>  <h4><h3><u>Additionally, an operating system can perform the following services for applications:</u></h3></h4>      
       <ul class="default-list"> 
   
  <li><h4>In a multitasking operating system, where multiple programs can be running at the same time, the OS determines which applications should run in what order and how much time should be allowed for each application before giving another application a turn.</li><li>It handles input/output (I/O) to and from attached hardware devices, such as hard disks, printers and dial-up ports.</li> 
  <li>It sends messages to each application or interactive user -- or to a system operator -- about the status of operation and any errors that may have occurred.</li> 
  <li>It can offload the management of <a href="https://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/definition/batch">batch</a> jobs -- for example, printing -- so that the initiating application is freed from this work.</li> 
  <li>On computers that can provide <a href="https://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/definition/parallel-processing">parallel processing</a>, an operating system can manage how to divide the program so that it runs on more than one processor at a time.</h4></li> 
 </ul> 
        <h4>All major computer platforms (hardware and software) require, and sometimes include, an operating system, and operating systems must be developed with different features to meet the specific needs of various&nbsp;<a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/form-factor">form factors</a>.</h4>
        <h4><strong>Device management.</strong> An operating system is responsible for identifying, configuring, and providing applications with common access to underlying computer hardware devices. As the OS recognizes and identifies hardware, the OS will install corresponding device drivers that enable the OS and applications running on the OS to use the devices without any specific knowledge of the hardware or devices.</h4>
        <h4>An operating system is responsible for identifying the correct printer and installing the appropriate printer drivers so that an application needs to only make calls to the printer without having to use codes or commands that are specific to that printer -- that is the operating system's job. The situation is similar for other devices, such as USB ports; networking ports; graphics devices, such as graphics processing units (GPUs); motherboard chipsets; and storage devices, such as Serial-Attached SCSI (SAS) disk adapters and disks that are formatted with a suitable file system.</h4>
        <h4>The OS identifies and configures physical and logical devices for service and typically records them in a standardized structure, such as Windows <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/registry">Registry</a>. Device manufacturers periodically patch and update drivers, and the OS should update them to ensure best device performance and security. When devices are replaced, the OS also installs and configures new drivers.</h4>

<h3><u>In an operating system software performs each of the function:</u></h3>
<li><h3>Process management</h3> Process management helps OS to create and delete processes. It also provides mechanisms for synchronization and communication among processes.</li>
<li><h3>Memory management</h3> Memory management module performs the task of allocation and de-allocation of memory space to programs in need of this resources.</li>
<li><h3>File management</h3> It manages all the file-related activities such as organization storage, retrieval, naming, sharing, and protection of files.</li>
<li> <li><h3>Device Management</h3>Device management keeps tracks of all devices. This module also responsible for this task is known as the I/O controller. It also performs the task of allocation and de-allocation of the devices.</li>
<li ><li><h3>I/O System Management</h3> One of the main objects of any OS is to hide the peculiarities of that hardware devices from the user.</li>
<li ><li><h3>Secondary-Storage Management</h3>: Systems have several levels of storage which includes primary storage, secondary storage, and cache storage. Instructions and data must be stored in primary storage or cache so that a running program can reference it. </li>
<li><li><h3>Command interpretation</h3> This module is interpreting commands given by the and acting system resources to process that commands.</li>

    <h2><u>Security</u></h2>
    <hr>
    <h4>Security refers to providing a protection system to computer system resources such as CPU, memory, disk, software programs and most importantly data/information stored in the computer system. If a computer program is run by an unauthorized user, then he/she may cause severe damage to computer or data stored in it. So a computer system must be protected against unauthorized access, malicious access to system memory, viruses, worms etc. We're going to discuss following topics in this chapter.</h4>
    <ul class="list">
<li>Authentication</li>
<li>One Time passwords</li>
<li>Program Threats</li>
<li>System Threats</li>
<li>Computer Security Classifications</li>
</ul>

    <h2><u>Authentication</u></h2>
    <h4>Authentication refers to identifying each user of the system and associating the executing programs with those users. It is the responsibility of the Operating System to create a protection system which ensures that a user who is running a particular program is authentic. Operating Systems generally identifies/authenticates users using following three ways −</h4>
    <ul class="list">
<li><p><h3>Username / Password</h3>− User need to enter a registered username and password with Operating system to login into the system.</p></li>
<li><p><h3>User card/key</h3> − User need to punch card in card slot, or enter key generated by key generator in option provided by operating system to login into the system.</p></li>
<li><p><h3>User attribute - fingerprint/ eye retina pattern/ signature</h3> − User need to pass his/her attribute via designated input device used by operating system to login into the system.</p></li>
</ul>
